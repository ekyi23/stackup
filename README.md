This project develops a customer support chatbot that leverages sentiment analysis to improve interactivity and responsiveness. The chatbot integrates a Hugging Face sentiment analysis model to detect user emotions, such as frustration or satisfaction. Depending on the sentiment, the chatbot dynamically adjusts its responsesâ€”for example, offering apologies and help for negative sentiments or providing encouraging responses for positive feedback. By using the Hugging Face pre-trained models and integrating them with a Python-based chatbot, the project aims to enhance the customer experience by making conversations more engaging and supportive.

The chats and responses are then saved into a csv for analyses later on.
